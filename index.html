                    April 2, 2011 Today, MS Dhoni and his men gave a billion Indian Cricket fans plenty
                    of joy as India trumped Sri Lanka in the World Cup final at the packed 
                    <i>Wankhede Stadium </i>in <i>Mumbai </i>to end their
                    28-year-old title drought. It is a triumph that will be remembered 
                    for ages as India had waited for 27 years, 9 months and
                     7 days to add 2nd World Cup to their kitty.

            <h4>Food Price Hike Worsens Poverty in Asia</h4>
            <p>
                An annual meeting of asian finance ministers and central bank governors
                in Hanoi is set to address the fate of 64 million people in the region on
                the brink of extreme poverty. They are the worst affected by soaring food 
                prices, which have hit record highs in the first two months of this year.

            </p>
            <p>
                If left unchecked, the food crisis will badly undermine the recent 
                gains in poverty reduction made in Asia. We estimate that a 10 percent
                rise in domestic food prices in developing Asia could push an additional 64 million people
                into poverty , based on the 1,25 (dollar)  a day poverty line.

            <h4>New Dangers Arise at Chernobyl</h4>
            <p>
                In the aftermath of the anniversary of the worst nuclear disaster
                in history, Ukrainian authorities have pledged not to abandon those 
                still in need of assistance. But many of the country's policies may be increasing 
                the risk of a new catastrophe.

                Chernobyl is still one of the most dangerous nuclear facilities
                in the world, Arthur Denisnko, energy expert at the National
                Ecological Centre of Ukraine told IPS.

            <h4>Human Rights Council Issues First - Ever UN Condemnation of Syria</h4>
            <p>
                The special session on syria held by the United Nations Human Rights Council 
                Friday agreed on neither an international mission of enquiry, as originally foreseen, nor
                a lower level fact - finding mission -only a mission by the office of the High Commisioner for Human Rights.

            </p>
            <p>
                The attitude taken in the session held at the request of the United States
                stands in sharp contrast to the strong action taken on Libya just two months ago.
